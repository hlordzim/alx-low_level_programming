# 0x0F. C - Function pointers

In C, like normal data pointers (int *, char *, etc), we can have pointers to functions

Like normal data pointers, a function pointer can be passed as an argument and can also be returned from a function.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## General
What are function pointers and how to use them
What does a function pointer exactly hold
Where does a function pointer point to in the virtual memory
